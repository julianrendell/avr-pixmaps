# Planar Based Display

Playing with some old-skool display ideas for use with AVR and other limited display environments.

## repl.it Notes
- everything below "runner" directory will be removed
- choosing a C++ repl from scratch defaults to the "run" button trying to compile everything
- add a `.replit` file and have run call `cmake`. See [the minimal documentation](https://docs.repl.it/repls/dot-replit) about this feature.
